## Thank You

Foremost, I want to thank you for reading this book or taking the full course. My greatest wish is that you had a great learning experience with the material. I hope you feel empowered now to build your own applications that use state management. I strive to go in the direction of education, so I depend on your feedback, both positive and critical.

I hope you enjoyed reading it and that it helped you to get traction in advanced state management with React. If you liked the book, share it, as a way to learn state management in React, with your friends. It can be used as giveaway. In addition, it would mean a lot to me if you could take 5 minutes to write a review about it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CYKDQ5S) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36599578-taming-the-state-in-react).

Visit [my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more topics about software and web development, and I have updates are available by [subscription](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch). The updates will be in-depth content, but never spam.

If you liked the learning experience, I hope you share it with others.  Think about people in your life who want to learn more about this topic, regardless of using React, React Native, Angular or Vue. I believe developers need to align on this topic to reach the next level with modern applications.

Thank you for reading,
Robin
